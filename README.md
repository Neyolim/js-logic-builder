I created this repository to build my JavaScript problem‑solving muscles—one challenge per day. Each file (e.g. `01-fibonacci.js`, `02-greatest-number.js`) contains:

- **The problem statement** at the top as a comment  
- **My solution** in plain JavaScript  
- **Basic test cases** so I can verify my approach

I’m following Ashish Saluja’s “JavaScript Logic Building” playlist, tackling 100 curated problems that start simple and grow in complexity. My goal isn’t just to get the right answer—I pause each video, brainstorm the logic on my own, and then code the solution. Over 100 days, I’ll track my progress, refine my thought process, and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures in JS.

By the end of this series, I expect to:

1. Have solved 100 real‑world style problems  
2. Cultivated a daily coding habit  
3. Mastered common patterns (loops, recursion, array/object methods)  
4. Improved my ability to break down complex challenges into clear, testable steps

Feel free to browse my solutions, suggest optimizations, or compare alternative approaches. Let’s code daily, learn continuously, and master JavaScript logic together!
